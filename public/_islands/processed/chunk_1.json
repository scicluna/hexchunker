It pulses with a soft, ethereal light. \n- Upon touching the crystal, the player's vision blurs momentarily before they are presented with a series of visions. These could be of past events, possible futures, or distant places. The visions are cryptic and require interpretation.\n- If the player attempts to remove or damage the crystal, they feel a strong resistance. The crystal is protected by the magic of the bouldershade mystics and cannot be easily tampered with.\n- After interacting with the crystal, the player might feel a lingering connection to the bouldershade mystics, potentially opening up new avenues for magical exploration or communication."

Some say it's a scar left by a powerful magical explosion, others believe it's a gateway to another realm.\n- The elven florists are a group of elves who have made their home near the abyss. They're known for their love of chess, often seen engrossed in intense games near the edge of the chasm. They're also known to be mischievous, leaving glowing footprints to lead the unwary on wild chases.\n- The footprints are said to lead to hidden treasures or secret locations, but more often than not, they simply lead back to the florists, who find amusement in the confusion and frustration of those who followed the prints.\n- The undefined hexes surrounding this location suggest unexplored territories, filled with potential dangers and wonders. These could be other parts of the shattered continent, each with its own unique features and encounters."

Elara's connection to them could hint at knowledge about this event. \n- Lastly, if travelers or locals learn about this connection, it could either instill fear, leading them to avoid Elara, or spark curiosity, drawing more people to her and the Dewy Bank."

The presence of hillfolk paladin warriors is suggested, hinting at a history of conflict and valor.\n- To the west, a flat wold is discovered. An old leather water flask found here tells tales of nomadic traders who once traversed these lands, perhaps trading goods with the sorcerer's sage to the northwest.\n- The eastern hex is a mounded down, where local tales speak of ridgeview falconers brewing wines of levitation near zones of floating water droplets. This hints at a magical presence, possibly connected to the boulder beast mages of the central hex.\n- The southwest hex is an ocean, its history and encounters yet undefined. It may serve as a natural barrier or a route for seafaring traders.\n- To the southeast, a mossy rise is marked by an abandoned backpack, hinting at the tales of hillcrest enchanters. This could be connected to the map of hidden hill passages found in the central hex, perhaps left behind by the same enchanters.\n- The central hex is an outstretched outcrop, where a map of hidden hill passages is found hidden among moss-covered stones. This map, seemingly lost by boulder beast mages, could be a key to navigating the surrounding hexes and their histories.",

This could have been used for clandestine meetings or rituals.\n- The passages could also lead to the northeast, to the eroded outcrop that was once a battleground. Perhaps these tunnels were used by the hillfolk paladin warriors for strategic advantage.\n- To the west, the passages might connect to the flat wold, providing a hidden path for the nomadic traders to move their goods.\n- The eastern passage likely leads to the mounded down, where ridgeview falconers brew their levitation wines. This could suggest a magical or alchemical connection between the falconers and the boulder beast mages.\n- The passage to the southeast probably leads to the mossy rise, possibly used by the hillcrest enchanters. The abandoned backpack found there might even belong to an enchanter who used these passages.\n- The passages do not seem to extend to the ocean to the southwest. However, they might lead to a hidden cove or dock used by seafaring traders or smugglers.",

However, traces of their presence can still be found.\n- To the northwest, the sorcerer's sage might hold clues about their whereabouts. The sun-soaked scarf found there could have been a gift from the mages, suggesting a close relationship.\n- The northeast hex, with its old battleground, might have been a site of conflict involving the mages. Perhaps they left to seek peace elsewhere.\n- To the west, the nomadic traders might have interacted with the mages. The old leather water flask could contain traces of their magic.\n- The eastern hex, with its tales of ridgeview falconers and levitation wines, suggests a strong magical presence. The mages might have migrated there to join these falconers.\n- The southeast hex, marked by an abandoned backpack, hints at the presence of hillcrest enchanters. The mages might have left to study under these enchanters, or they might have become enchanters themselves.\n- The passages in the central hex could provide a clue to their current location. The mages might have used these passages to travel secretly between the hexes, and could still be hiding in one of them."
