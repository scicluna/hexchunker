            "- The current hex is a terrain of abyssal abyss, a deep and seemingly endless chasm that cuts through the islands. It's a dark and mysterious place, filled with an eerie silence that's only broken by the occasional gust of wind echoing through the depths.\n- The abyss is rumored to have been created during the grand catastrophe that shattered the continent, its depths reaching down into the very heart of the world. Some say it's a scar left by a powerful magical explosion, others believe it's a gateway to another realm.\n- The elven florists are a group of elves who have made their home near the abyss. They're known for their love of chess, often seen engrossed in intense games near the edge of the chasm. They're also known to be mischievous, leaving glowing footprints to lead the unwary on wild chases.\n- The footprints are said to lead to hidden treasures or secret locations, but more often than not, they simply lead back to the florists, who find amusement in the confusion and frustration of those who followed the prints.\n- The undefined hexes surrounding this location suggest unexplored territories, filled with potential dangers and wonders. These could be other parts of the shattered continent, each with its own unique features and encounters."
